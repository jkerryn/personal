## About Me

I am a researcher in Geographic Information Science specializing in cartography, geovisual analytics, and user-centered design with applications in fitness and health, politics, socioeconomics, transportation, and urban planning. My work emphasizes the significant role of visual communication in making spatial data more accessible, legible, and valuable.

I hold a Ph.D. in Geography with a minor in Social Data Analytics from the Pennsylvania State University. During my doctoral studies, I was awarded an NSF traineeship in Big Data Social Science where I both gained experience with, and brought a geographic perspective to, data privacy, human-computer interaction, machine learning, and social networks. I had the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse team of computer scientists, demographers, political scientists, statisticians, and other geographers to develop interdisciplinary approaches to addressing important social science questions. My dissertation explored how to design maps and other visualizations constructed from personal movement data and intended to benefit the data creator be it directly or through the use of one's data for public planning or service provision. The body of work illuminated the ability of personal visualizations to facilitate improved memory and self-awareness, as well as help make our interactions in places better and more meaningful. However, the findings also reinforced the need for developing design guidelines for personal movement data interaction and visualization. 

In my current role as a GIScientist at the Vermont Agency of Transportation’s Asset Management Bureau, I lead applied research efforts to design, implement, and evaluate novel approaches to making transportation asset data more actionable to internal stakeholders and the public. I serve as a member of the Technical Advisory Committee for State-funded transportation projects and as the State liaison for a collaborative project with the University of Vermont’s Artificial Intelligence Lab that employs computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect, classify, and geolocate roadside assets from right-of-way imagery.
